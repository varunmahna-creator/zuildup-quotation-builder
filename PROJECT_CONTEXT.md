## 1. What This Is

A web-based quotation/cost-estimate builder for **ZuildUp's** sales team to generate luxury-grade, customer-facing PDF quotes for high-end interior fitouts (NCR luxury segment, ticket size ₹2 Cr+).

**Core flow:**
1. Sales rep enters customer details (name, project address, plot/built-up area)
2. Picks a calculator mode (3 modes: per-sqft, area-based, line-item)
3. Picks line items from a catalog (~57 items: civil, joinery, kitchen, wardrobes, electrical, HVAC, plumbing, etc.)
4. Adjusts per-line rates if needed (Phase 3 added this)
5. Hits "Download PDF" → gets a 13-page polished PDF: cover, area summary, itemized cost sheet, detailed specs, T&Cs.

**Why it matters:** Replaces ad-hoc DOCX/Excel quotes the sales team used to pass around. Branded, consistent, fast.

## 3. Architecture (Quick Overview)

**Single-tenant SPA + thin Node server.** No DB, no API layer. All state in `localStorage`. PDF rendering is client-side via headless Chrome (the browser does the layout, then `window.print()` saves to PDF).

```
Browser (Chrome / Edge)
  index.html (form UI)
  quote.js   (PDF gen)
  embedded_fonts.css (base64 woff2)
        |
        v window.print() -> PDF
        |
        v (auth + static)
Cloud Run: zuildup-quotes (Node 20, Express)
  - server.js: Basic Auth, static file serve
  - Sets Content-Disposition for PDF filename
```

### Key files

| File | Purpose | Size |
|------|---------|------|
| `app/server.js` | Express app, Basic Auth, static + PDF download routes | 483 lines |
| `app/index.html` | Main SPA form UI | 381 lines |
| `app/quote.js` | Generates the multi-page PDF preview HTML, line-item logic, calculators | 2403 lines |
| `app/assets/embedded_fonts.css` | Base64-embedded woff2 fonts (Fraunces + Inter) | 213 KB |
| `catalog/` | JSON catalog of 57 line items (descriptions, default rates) | — |
| `scripts/build_quote_js.py` | Builds `quote.js` from sources (templates + catalog injection) | — |
| `Dockerfile` | Node 20 Alpine, runs `node app/server.js` | — |
| `package.json` | Deps: only `sharp` (image compression for embedded photos) | — |

### Phase 4 storage stack
- **Source of truth:** Firestore Native (project `zuildup-quotes`, location `asia-south1`, database `(default)`, collection `quotes`).
- **Document shape:** `{id, name, customer_name, author, last_edited_by, created_at, modified_at, row_count, state: <full quote state>}`. Document id == slot id (`q_<ts>_<rand>`).
- **Hot cache:** localStorage in browser. `QuoteStorage` writes there first (sync), pushes to cloud in background.
- **Boot sync:** `QuoteStorage.syncFromCloud()` runs at start of `bootForm()` and again when Load modal opens. 4s timeout — if cloud is slow, falls through to local cache.
- **Failure mode:** 3 consecutive API failures disable cloud sync for the session. Rep keeps using localStorage; nothing breaks.

### Local dev with Firestore
- Need either `gcloud auth application-default login` (uses your gcloud creds) OR `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/sa.json`.
- Set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=zuildup-quotes` env var (or `FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID`).
- Local writes hit the SAME Firestore as production — be careful with test data (use clearly-prefixed names).

### Boot dev environment
```bash
cd /opt/openclaw/workspace/zuildup/quotation-builder
PORT=8124 GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=zuildup-quotes nohup node app/server.js > /tmp/_qb_server.log 2>&1 &
# Server on http://localhost:8124

# For headless PDF tests:
google-chrome --headless=new --no-sandbox --disable-gpu \
  --user-data-dir=/tmp/qb_chrome_p1567 --remote-debugging-port=9223 \
  --remote-allow-origins='*' --window-size=1400,900 about:blank &
```

## 4. Brand & Design Language

- **Primary navy:** `#0A1F44`
- **Gold:** `#C9A24D`
- **Off-white:** `#F9FAF7`
- **Display serif:** Fraunces (variable, latin + latin-ext)
- **Body sans:** Inter (variable)
- **Cover word "ZuildUp":** inline SVG, `font-family="Inter, sans-serif"` (huge, gold on navy)
- **Tagline:** Fraunces serif italic
- **Customer h1:** Fraunces serif

**Customer-facing PDF must look polished/luxury.** Always do thorough vision QC before deploy.

## 5. Phase History (Most Recent First)

### Phase 5 (May 2) — Sales-team feedback fixes (4 issues)
Triggered by sales team reporting wrong zone sums, missing Concrete spec, off-by-one lift/staircase counts, and confusing line-item descriptions when areas were manually overridden.

**Fixes:**
1. **Concrete added to Structure specs.** New `structure.concrete` catalog entry (description/spec may be blank — section header always renders).
2. **Zone sum QC.** `applyAreaOverrides` had three compounding bugs:
   - `dirty` flag declared outside per-zone loop → leaked across zones, causing stale recomputes.
   - `it.cost` not recomputed after `it.area = newArea` → stale per-item costs.
   - `z.cost = z.total × z.rate` discarded per-item rate overrides — Lift at ₹3,000 silently reverted to zone-default ₹2,000 when ANY area in the zone was overridden.
   - **Fix:** scoped `zoneDirty` per zone, `it.cost = it.area × it.rate`, `z.cost = Σ(item.cost)`. Σ(rows) == zone total under all override permutations.
3. **Lift/staircase count rework.** All 3 calculator modes now use the same formula: `numFloors + (hasStilt ? 1 : 0) + (hasBasement ? 1 : 0) + 1` — the `+1` is the mumty stop (rooftop access, not billable as separate area but counted as a level for staircase steps + lift stops).
   - Basement + Stilt + 4 Floors → 7 levels
   - Stilt + 4 Floors → 6 levels
   - `calcPackage` was missing the `+1`; `calcAreaBased` already had it.
4. **Area-override description.** When `state.areaOverrides[zone:item]` is set, line description becomes generic `"as per design scope"` (replacing calc-method strings like "Floor Area (4500) − Lift (25) − Staircase (125)"). Rate-only overrides still keep the calc string.

**Tests:** 13 new tests in `tests/test_phase5.py` lock all 4 invariants. Existing suite still green.

**Live verification:** PDF rendered against live URL post-deploy confirms all 4 fixes manifest in customer artifact. md5 of local `app/quote.js` matches live (`10f00d32138dcaf3de492de141a13fe7`).

**Commits:** `d1ad3f6` (code) + `0aa343f` (docs).

**Open follow-ups:**
- If sales also wants "as per design scope" on RATE-only overrides (not just area), it's a one-line addition in `enrichZone`. Out of scope this round.
- Mumty is a stop (counted for staircase/lift) but not a billable area — flagging in case future scope changes this.

### Phase 4.1 (May 1) — Per-rep logins
- 5 individual logins (varun/karan/avish/vaishali/rajat) instead of one shared `zuildup-sales` account.
- Each quote's `author` field now records the actual creator's username; `last_edited_by` tracks who last touched it.
- Server: `requireAuth` now checks against `AUTH_USERS_JSON` env var (a JSON dict). Falls back to legacy `AUTH_USER`/`AUTH_PASS` single-user mode if not set.
- Backward compat: `zuildup-sales` / `zuildup` still works as a temporary fallback. Plan to remove it after the team has switched over.

### Phase 4 (May 1) — Cross-device quote library (Firestore-backed)
- **The problem:** quotes lived only in `localStorage`. Sales team (Karan, Avish, Varun) couldn't revisit a quote on another device or browser. If a rep cleared cache or switched laptops, work was lost.
- **The fix:** server-side quote storage in Firestore (Native, asia-south1).
  - 5 new endpoints under `/api/quotes` (GET list, GET id, POST, PUT, DELETE) behind existing Basic Auth.
  - Each quote carries `author` (creator's auth username) + `last_edited_by` so the team knows who built/touched it. Quotes are TEAM-SHARED — any authenticated user sees all quotes.
  - `QuoteStorage` keeps its **synchronous** API (so all 25+ existing call sites work unchanged) but now does background `_apiPush` on save/_touch/delete.
  - On boot AND when the Load modal opens, `syncFromCloud()` pulls remote-newer quotes into local cache + pushes local-only quotes up (one-time migration of pre-Phase-4 data).
  - Auto-save (`_touch`) is debounced 1.5s before API push to avoid hammering Firestore on every keystroke.
  - "Saving…/Synced" indicator now shows pending pushes.
  - Load modal lists author next to each quote (`by zuildup-sales`).
- **GCP setup:** Firestore Native database created in `asia-south1`. Cloud Run service account `586295767597-compute@developer` granted `roles/datastore.user` (also has Editor inherited).
- **Deps:** `@google-cloud/firestore` ^7.10 (auto-auth via metadata server on Cloud Run).
- **End-to-end verified on live URL:** save quote on device A → clear localStorage → reload → quote auto-restores from Firestore. Delete propagates cloud-ward.

### Phase 3 (Apr 30 — May 1) — Sales-team feedback iteration
- **v2 (`eb5b332`)**: per-line-item rates editable (sales asked for this), UI/PDF polish, 10 small UX changes
- **v2.1 (`6461863`)**: lift machine cost made editable
- **v2.2 (`7131532`)**: 🔥 PDF layout fixes — unified `pg-specs-flow` single section eliminates per-category orphan headers + base64-embedded fonts (offline-safe). Took the PDF from 20pp (with blanks) to 13pp dense.
- **v2.3 (`cb8a615`)**: 🔥 ₹ glyph rendering fix on cost/area pages. Embedded font subsets in v2.2 lacked U+20B9 — replaced with Fraunces latin+latin-ext (₹ in latin-ext) + custom rsms.me Inter subset with explicit ₹ inclusion.

### Phase 2 (Apr 28 — Apr 29) — Production-ready
- P0.1: catalog v2 (drop tier system, derive from customer-facing DOCX)
- P0.2: 3-mode calculator port + form rebuild + about page
- P0.3: about-page polish + breadcrumb cleanup + canonical naming
- P1.1: PDF asset inlining + spec pagination + cover UX
- P1.2: Catalog fidelity pass (restore price caps stripped during DOCX extraction)
- P1.3: Catalog modularization (catalog as template/dictionary, pricing per-quote)
- P1.4: Sales UX polish (keyboard nav, unedited-row visual, New Quote button)
- P1.5: Quote Save/Load + Multi-Customer (storage layer, modals, auto-save, export/import)
- P1.5.1: Catalog description prose-scrub
- P1.6: PDF download polish (filename, draft watermark, image compression via sharp)
- P1.7: Field validation + business rules
- Deploy: Cloud Run + Dockerfile + simpler password
- Closeout: `PROJECT_ARCHIVE.md` written, project stood down

### Phase 1 (Apr 28) — Baseline
- Catalog of 57 items
- bugs.md, mock data, builder app, end-to-end PDF export working

---

## 6. Known Issues & Watchlist

### ✅ Resolved
- ~~Blank page in PDF (orphan headers)~~ → fixed in v2.2 (unified pg-specs-flow)
- ~~"Font changed" on home page~~ → was a misread; deploy mismatch (v2.2 wasn't deployed yet)
- ~~₹ tofu / missing-glyph on cost sheet~~ → fixed in v2.3 (proper font subsets)

### 🟡 Watch
- **Firestore quotas (Phase 4):** free tier is generous (50K reads, 20K writes/day) but watch out — `_touch` fires a write every 1.5s of typing. Consider further debounce if usage spikes.
- **Embedded font subsets for non-Latin glyphs:** if anyone adds new currency/special chars (₿, ৳, ฿, etc.), they will tofu unless `used_chars.txt` is updated and `embedded_fonts.css` rebuilt. See section 8.
- **Filesystem cache lag:** Workspace FS sometimes shows phantom ENOENT for fresh writes. Workaround: `sync; sleep 1; bash -lc 'ls ...'` and prefer `stat` over `ls`.
- **Deploy != commit.** Always verify the live revision matches local HEAD via `gcloud run services describe zuildup-quotes --region asia-south1 --format='value(status.latestReadyRevisionName)'` before debugging "fix didn't work."

## 7. QC / Verification Procedure

Before declaring any change "done," run this end-to-end:

### 7.1 Tests
```bash
cd /opt/openclaw/workspace/zuildup/quotation-builder
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v
```
Expected:
- `test_catalog_fidelity` ✅
- `test_quote_storage` 8/8 ✅
- `test_p16_cdp` 4/4 ✅
- `test_p17_cdp` 4/4 ✅

> Note: `test_p16_cdp` and `test_p17_cdp` share Chrome localStorage and must run sequentially.

### 7.2 Local PDF render
```bash
cd /tmp/qb_qc
python3 render_live_pdf2.py  # full customer fixture, 13pp expected
pdftotext local_quote.pdf - | tr -cd '\0' | wc -c   # should be 0
pdftotext local_quote.pdf - | grep -o '₹' | wc -l    # should be 14
```

### 7.3 Live PDF render after deploy
```bash
# Wait for deploy then:
python3 /tmp/qb_qc/render_live_pdf2.py   # uses Basic Auth
# Check: pages == 13, NULLs == 0, ₹ count == 14
```

### 7.4 Vision QC
Use the `image` tool with a clear, perceptual prompt:
> "Is the rupee symbol (₹ — looks like R with two horizontal bars) rendering correctly on the cost page, or do you see boxes/tofu/missing-glyph squares?"

**DO NOT** ask for digit-by-digit numerical reads via the image tool — that's the confident-wrong failure mode (see MEMORY.md Apr 28). Vision is reliable for **perceptual** comparisons (glyph vs tofu, layout looks right vs broken), unreliable for **numerical** verification.

### 7.5 Cover/full visual sweep
Render pages to PNG and eyeball pages 1, 2, 7, 13 at minimum:
- Page 1: cover renders Fraunces serif tagline + customer h1 + giant Inter SVG "ZuildUp"
- Page 2: about/intro
- Page 5: cost sheet — ₹ symbols correct, totals readable
- Page 7: ~75-80% density, no orphan headers
- Page 13: T&Cs, no truncation

---

## 8. The ₹ Fix (Critical Reference)

If anyone asks "what was the ₹ fix?" — this is the canonical explanation.

**Problem:** v2.2 replaced Google Fonts CDN with base64-embedded woff2 fonts in `app/assets/embedded_fonts.css`. The default Google Fonts "latin" subset only contains ~230 glyphs (basic Latin + $/£/€ at U+20AC). It does **NOT** include ₹ (U+20B9).

When the PDF renderer hit a ₹ in the cost sheet, the glyph wasn't in the font, so headless Chrome rendered a missing-glyph tofu box. In the PDF text layer this manifests as `\x00` NULL bytes.

**Solution (v2.3):**
1. **Fraunces:** include both `latin` AND `latin-ext` subsets from Google Fonts. The `latin-ext` subset covers U+20AD–U+20C0, which includes ₹.
2. **Inter:** Google Fonts Inter `latin-ext` ALSO lacks ₹ (different subset definition). So we used **rsms.me Inter** (`InterVariable.woff2`, the official source, 2852 glyphs) and subsetted it ourselves with `pyftsubset` using a `used_chars.txt` that explicitly includes ₹.
3. **`unicode-range` declarations** in @font-face tell the browser which font to use for which codepoints.

**Result:** Belt + suspenders — both fonts now include ₹.

### Files of record
- `/tmp/qb_qc/build_embedded_fonts_v2.py` — build script
- `/tmp/qb_qc/used_chars.txt` — character whitelist used for Inter subsetting
- `/tmp/qb_qc/fonts/InterVariable.woff2` — rsms.me master (2852 glyphs)
- `/tmp/qb_qc/fonts/Inter_subset.woff2` — our 96-glyph subset (32 KB)
- `/tmp/qb_qc/fonts/fraunces_latin.woff2` — Google Fonts
- `/tmp/qb_qc/fonts/fraunces_latin_ext.woff2` — Google Fonts (contains ₹)
- `app/assets/embedded_fonts.css` — final base64-embedded CSS (213 KB)

### pyftsubset command
```bash
pyftsubset InterVariable.woff2 \
  --text-file=used_chars.txt \
  --output-file=Inter_subset.woff2 \
  --flavor=woff2 \
  --no-hinting \
  --desubroutinize \
  --layout-features='kern,liga,calt,clig,onum,tnum'
```

### To add new glyphs in future
1. Add the character to `/tmp/qb_qc/used_chars.txt`
2. Re-run `pyftsubset` to regenerate `Inter_subset.woff2`
3. Re-run `/tmp/qb_qc/build_embedded_fonts_v2.py` → produces new `embedded_fonts.css`
4. Copy to `app/assets/embedded_fonts.css`
5. Re-run `python3 scripts/build_quote_js.py` → outputs `/tmp/_quote_v2.js`, then `cp /tmp/_quote_v2.js app/quote.js`
6. Local QC → commit → deploy

---

## 9. Common Operations Cheatsheet

### Check what's live right now
```bash
gcloud run services describe zuildup-quotes --region asia-south1 \
  --format='value(status.latestReadyRevisionName,status.url)'
```

### Tail Cloud Run logs
```bash
gcloud run services logs read zuildup-quotes --region asia-south1 --limit 50
```

### Roll back to previous revision
```bash
gcloud run services update-traffic zuildup-quotes \
  --to-revisions=zuildup-quotes-00011-jq5=100 \
  --region asia-south1
```

### Compare local quote.js md5 vs live
```bash
md5sum app/quote.js
curl -s -u zuildup-sales:zuildup https://zuildup-quotes-zim2owjloq-el.a.run.app/app/quote.js | md5sum
```
If they don't match, the deploy didn't go through.

### Render live PDF and verify
```bash
python3 /tmp/qb_qc/render_live_pdf2.py
# Outputs /tmp/qb_qc/live_v23.pdf (or similar)
# Should print: pages=13, NULLs=0, ₹=14
```

### Quick local server reboot
```bash
pkill -f 'node app/server.js'
cd /opt/ocplatform/workspace/zuildup/quotation-builder
nohup node app/server.js > /tmp/_qb_server.log 2>&1 &
```

## 10. Doctrine (Lessons Earned)

These are the durable rules that bit us on this project. Tape them to the monitor.

1. **Deploy != commit.** The single biggest time-waster on this project was assuming v2.2 was live when it was just committed. Always verify revision before debugging.
2. **Embedded fonts are a ticking time bomb for non-Latin glyphs.** Any glyph not in your subset = tofu in production. Maintain `used_chars.txt` and rebuild fonts on any content change touching new symbols.
3. **PDF NULL byte triage is a 5-second check.** `pdftotext file.pdf - | tr -cd '\0' | wc -c`. Should be 0. Run it on every PDF QC pass.
4. **Vision QC is reliable for perception, dangerous for numbers.** Use it for "does this look broken" / "is this glyph rendered." Never "what's the total in this row."
5. **Customer-facing artifact = end-to-end verification on live URL.** Build passing ≠ done. Render the live PDF, eyeball it, then declare done.
6. **3+ commits on the same bug = stop and rethink.** Don't keep patching. The bug is a signal the architecture or mental model is wrong.
7. **FS cache lag on this VM is real.** When fresh writes seem missing, `sync; sleep 1` + use absolute paths. Don't loop on retries.

---

## 11. Quick Resume Script

If you just woke up cold and need to verify the system is healthy:

```bash
cd /opt/openclaw/workspace/zuildup/quotation-builder

# 1. Git state
git log --oneline -5

# 2. What's live
gcloud run services describe zuildup-quotes --region asia-south1 \
  --format='value(status.latestReadyRevisionName,status.url)'

# 3. Local vs live md5
md5sum app/quote.js
curl -s -u zuildup-sales:zuildup \
  https://zuildup-quotes-zim2owjloq-el.a.run.app/quote.js | md5sum

# 4. Live PDF health (if /tmp/qb_qc still exists)
python3 /tmp/qb_qc/render_live_pdf2.py 2>&1 | tail -5
```

If md5s match and PDF renders 13 pages with 0 NULLs and 14 ₹, system is healthy.
